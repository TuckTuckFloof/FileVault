What is the purpose?
    To code python ya headass
    Also to create a password protected "Vault" system for files
    I literally wont use it but it would be neat

What should it do?
    Input a username and password to access the file of choice
    If the username and password is incorrect, then it denies access
    If the information is correct, then the Vault opens
    When vault is openend, it should be able to add, delete, and edit files but for editing we could just use g-edit or something idk
